## 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
I think the most interesting topic is how intricate the energy infrastructure is and how so many different working parts are necessary in just one electric pole that plays a role in the larger electric grid. The complexity of the system poses serious risks and it is very impressive the efforts and solutions SDG&E have developed in order to ensure public safety. As a resident of the San Diego area, I find this matter to be important and can better appreciate what SDG&E is doing.

## 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I would like to investigate how to more efficiently monitor power utilities and identify faulty equipment that are at risk of causing fires through the use of computer vision.

## 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
Instead of manually selecting Google Streetview images, I would like to explore ways to automate the image data collection and the identification of faulty equipment.

## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I want to explore computer vision techniques and machine learning models that can hopefully help SDG&E in their mission to mitigate fire risk due to electric utilities. I also want to consider using different types of data, like the use of satellite data.
